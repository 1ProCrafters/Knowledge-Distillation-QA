**Project Title: Objective Knowledge Distillation and Question-Answering System**

**Overview**

This project introduces a two-stage system designed to objectively extract and process information from complex text documents and use it to answer user queries.

**Stage 1: Objective Knowledge Distillation Model**

The primary goal of this model is to distill complex text documents, such as research papers, into concise, objective arguments. This distillation process eliminates subjective elements like ad hominem attacks, logical fallacies, and misinterpretations of data. By focusing on the core argument, the model ensures a rigorous and unbiased foundation for subsequent analysis.

**Stage 2: Question-Answering Language Model**

The question-answering model is trained exclusively on the output of the distillation model. This ensures that the responses are grounded in objective facts and avoid introducing biases or subjective interpretations. Users can pose queries related to the distilled argument, and the model will provide concise and informative answers.

**Motivation**

The increasing volume of information and the prevalence of misinformation necessitate tools that can accurately extract and understand the core arguments of complex texts. This project aims to provide a reliable and objective solution to this challenge.

**Technical Approach**

**Objective Knowledge Distillation Model (Current Goals):**

1. **Preprocessing:** Clean and tokenize the input text.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Employ a robust language model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to extract relevant features.
3. **Argument Extraction:** Utilize advanced techniques like attention mechanisms and sequence-to-sequence models to identify and extract the core argument.
4. **Fallacy and Bias Detection:** Implement a rigorous system to detect and eliminate logical fallacies, ad hominem attacks, and biases.
5. **Fact-Checking:** Integrate external knowledge sources or knowledge graph-based techniques to verify claims and ensure accuracy.

**Question-Answering Language Model (Current Goals):**

1. **Model Selection:** Choose a suitable language model architecture for the task.
2. **Training:** Train the model exclusively on the distilled arguments to ensure alignment with the objective information.
3. **Question Answering:** Leverage attention mechanisms and other advanced techniques to process user queries and generate relevant, informative, and objective responses.

**Future Goals**

* **Model Refinement:** Continuously refine the models to improve accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.
* **Ethical Considerations:** Proactively address potential biases and ethical implications of AI-generated content.
* **User Interface:** Develop a user-friendly interface to facilitate interaction with the system.
